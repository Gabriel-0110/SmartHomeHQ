Add a new device: $ARGUMENTS

Do:
1) Decide ownership (HA vs Scrypted vs Homebridge vs direct HomeKit).
2) Update 00-Inventory/device-inventory.csv with correct protocol, hub, and exposure decision.
3) Recommend naming, labels, and dashboard placement.
4) Provide a short validation checklist.

Never double-bridge. Prefer local control.
