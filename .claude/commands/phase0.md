Run Phase 0 using this repo’s canonical baselines:
- 00-Inventory/device-inventory.csv
- 01-Network/current-network.md
- 02-HomeAssistant/ha-baseline.md

Output:
1) 00-Inventory/ownership-map.md
2) 00-Inventory/homekit-exposure-list.md
3) Any corrections to device-inventory.csv (only if needed)
4) roadmap.md refinements (phases, risks, rollback notes)

Follow repo rules: one source of truth per device, no double-bridge, local-first, privacy-first.
